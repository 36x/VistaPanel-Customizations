# Usage
Go to JS/CSS folder and find the script you wanted to use.

A script will have 3 files :
  * The script itself (.js)
  * Minified version of the script (.min.js)
  * Instruction (.md)
  
Read the instruction file first, after understanding the instruction go ahead and
use GitHack or GitCDN to create a link to the file with the proper Content-Type header
or download the file and upload it to your site or to a CDN.

The rest, see .md files.
