Responsive Domain Search  

Used for :  
Making the search form responsive.

Where to put?  
Anywhere

Installation :   
Create a script tag with src pointing to responsive-domain-search.js or responsive-domain-search.min.js for minified version and place it on the footer ads (Recomended).  

Initialization :   
A variable "affliate code" can be defined to put your own affliate code on the domain search but according to iFastNet, this will not gave you any money.  

Variable :   
	* affCode -> 5 digit affliate code.  

If the variable is not declared, an affliate code for my account (PlanetCloud) will be used.  
In case this does actually pay money, the money will go into my account and I will appriciate it as a donation :).  

#NOTE : USE GITHACK OR GITCDN TO MAKE SURE THE CONTENT-TYPE HEADER IS SET CORRECTLY.
